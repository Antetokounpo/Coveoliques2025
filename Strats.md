# Strats

## Les actions les plus payantes (Ore) : 

1. Pick up Blitzium Cores
2. Clean Radiant Cores
3. Pick up Blitzium Ingot
4. Clean Radiant Slag
5. Pick up Blitzium Nugget

## RÃ©partitions des cars

For 1-2 Cars:

Focus on defensive play since you have limited resources
Prioritize collecting blitzium_core (5 points) while avoiding radiant materials entirely
Use your limited cars to patrol a smaller, defensible territory rather than trying to cover the whole map
When carrying valuable cores, take safer but longer routes to avoid interception

For 3-4 Cars:

Implement a "buddy system" where cars work in pairs
One car can act as a defender/interceptor while its partner collects resources
Dedicate 1-2 cars specifically for disrupting opponent collection patterns
The 20-turn respawn penalty makes car preservation crucial, so avoid risky interceptions unless the point trade is clearly favorable

For 5-6 Cars:

You can now implement a more complex strategy with specialized roles:

2 cars for pure collection (focusing on cores and ingots)
2 cars for territorial control and interception
1-2 cars for strategic disruption of opponent patterns or as "flex" positions


Consider sacrificing one car for a high-value interception, as you have enough remaining cars to maintain map control during the respawn penalty
Create "zones of control" where multiple cars can support each other
